# d-cimgui

A D wrapper to the [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui) wrapper of [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). This provides dynamic bindings. Static bindings are not supported.

Notice: this compiles and is in the process of being tested. Function default parameters are in the process of being added. The binding generator did not handle default values.

This is compatible with IMGUI v1.70
